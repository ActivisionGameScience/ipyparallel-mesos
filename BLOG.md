# Deploying an ipython ipyparallel mesos deployment



The Analytics Services team here at Activision are heavy users of [mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) and [marathon](https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon) to deploy and mangage services on our clusters. We are also huge fans of python and the jupyter project. The [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) project recently reogorganized from IPython, in a move refered to as "the split". One part that was orginally part of IPython (`IPython.parallel`) that was split off into a seperate project is [ipyparallel](https://github.com/ipython/ipyparallel). This powerful component of the IPython ecosystem is generally overlooked. 

In the post we will cover an introduction to ipyparallel and introduce a new way to deploy an ipython cluster on mesos.
