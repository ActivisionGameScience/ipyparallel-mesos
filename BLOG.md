# ipyparallel mesos deployment



We are heavy users of [mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) marathon to help deploy and mangage our clusters. We are also huge fans of python and the jupyter project. 

The [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) project recently reogorganized from IPython, in a move refered to as "the split". One part that was orginally part of IPython that was split off into a seperate project is [ipyparallel](https://github.com/ipython/ipyparallel). This powerful component of the IPython ecosystem is generally overlooked. In the post we will cover an introduction to ipyparallel and introduce a new way to deploy a cluster on mesos.
